In Word, a paragraph shows up in the Navigation Pane > Headings section if its style has an outline level set to Level 1–9 (used for headings).
Your style general may still be set to Outline Level: Level 1, which makes it behave like a heading.
✅ How to fix it (remove it from Navigation Pane):
1. Open the Modify Style window (as shown in your first image).

Click Modify on the "Styles" pane.

2. Click Format (bottom-left corner), then select Paragraph.
3. In the Paragraph settings window:

Look for Outline Level

Change it from Level 1 (or any level) to Body Text

4. Click OK, then OK again to save the style.
