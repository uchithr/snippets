### HIGHLIGHT EVERY NUMBER THAT EXCEEDS 100 IN THE "TIME=101MS" COLUMN IN EXCEL

Open your Excel file.
Select the column where the ping results are located (e.g., the column containing "time=101ms").
Go to the "Home" tab on the Excel ribbon.
Click on "Conditional Formatting" in the toolbar.
Choose "New Rule" from the dropdown menu.
In the "New Formatting Rule" dialog box, select "Use a formula to determine which cells to format."

Enter the following formula:

   =VALUE(MID(A1,FIND("time=",A1)+5,3))>100
   
Make sure to adjust the cell reference (A1) to the top-left cell of your selected range.
Click on the "Format" button to set the formatting options for the cells that meet the condition. You can choose a different font color, fill color, or any other formatting style.
After setting the formatting options, click "OK" to close the Format Cells dialog box.
Click "OK" again in the New Formatting Rule dialog box.
Now, the cells in the selected column that contain numbers exceeding 100 in the "time=101ms" format will be highlighted based on your chosen formatting style.
